Title: How to obtain the implementation address from an upgradeable proxy smart contract?

Details: Is there any way to externally obtain the current implementation address of a proxy that doesn't involve interacting actively with it (e.g. calling a transfer or approve function, i.e. without using gas)?
Let's use for example the USDC ERC-20 token, which its upgradeable proxy smart contract's address is: 0xA0b8...eB48 and it's current contract implementation to which it delegates to with the fallback function is 0xb727...78a2.
Is it possible?
